what it does: chrome extension for zebratester recording. May be pointed to a controller/remote install of zebratester

usage/buttons:

home - opens a new window with the defined instance of zebratester displayed -- becomes active once options are set.
play - start recording -- becomes active once options are set.
pause - stop recording -- becomes active once options are set.
reset - dumps your chrome cache, sets chromes proxy to your ZT instance, and resets the active recording in ZT. -- becomes active once options are set.
  * reset may also be right clicked on -- this will clear the recording WITHOUT dumping your chrome cache.
pagebreak - inserts a pagebreak -- becomes active once options are set.
settings - configure your zebratester instance here. Can be remote IP or 127.0.0.1 if running locally. 


TODO/IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Pagebreak and reset recording should not be active with 0 recorded items.
2. Keyboard shortcuts for Zebra commands. Eg: ALT+SHIFT+H = home, ALT+SHIFT+R = reset, etc..

THOUGHTS:

1. Allow multiple users to record against a remote ZT instance? Get recording state, if it's recording currently, do not let someone else record? Just an idea..
