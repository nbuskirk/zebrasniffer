v1.5 changelog--

Icons and UI updated across the board to be zebrasniffer specific. All references to proxysniffer changed to zebratester.

* New - Custom Bypass/Ignore list added to options. Filter 3rd parties before even recording :D
* New - Pagebreak UI reworked. Now a text-element, press ENTER to submit break.
* New - Notification system has been swapped out with chrome notifications instead. Disappear automatically and allow icons :) 
* New - Right clicking on reset recording will keep cache, and reset the recording. Use this to keep your browser cache intact.
* New - Keyboard Commands:
		COMMAND+SHIFT+Z = Open ZebraSniffer
		CTRL+SHIFT+Z = Open ZebraSniffer (Other OS')

* Resetting your recording no longer sets the proxy. This is intentionally decoupled.
